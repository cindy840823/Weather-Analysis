# Weather Data Fetch and Analysis

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to fetch, analyze, and visualize real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It is designed to showcase essential skills in API integration, data analysis, and visualization, making it a valuable addition to any data science portfolio.

---

## Goals
- Fetch and analyze real-time weather data for multiple cities using REST APIs.
- Perform statistical analysis on key weather metrics like temperature and humidity.
- Visualize weather patterns and trends using bar charts.
- Enable interactive exploration of city-specific weather data.

---

## Methodology
1. **Fetch Weather Data:** Retrieve real-time weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Process Data:** Extract key metrics such as temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Summarize the data with descriptive statistics and calculate correlations between metrics.
4. **Data Visualization:** Create bar charts to display temperature and humidity trends across cities.
5. **Interactive Exploration:** Use widgets to explore city-specific weather data interactively.

## Results
- Successfully fetched weather data for cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.
- Generated statistical summaries and visualized trends using bar charts.
- Enabled interactive exploration of city-specific weather data through widgets.
